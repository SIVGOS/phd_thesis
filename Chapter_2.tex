\chapter{A Theoretical Overview of Microstrip Antennas and Introduction to Metamaterials}
\label{chap:chap2}
This chapter covers the fundamental theoretical considerations of the project. The basic theoretical concepts of various parts of microstrip antennas, their feeding methods, the design considerations and the techniques for performance improvement of microstrip antennas are discussed. A brief note on the various metamaterials, their evolution and applications are also included in the chapter. Finally, a detailed discussion of the CSRR along with its equivalent circuit and the related mathematical expressions is provided.
