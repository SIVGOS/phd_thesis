~~~~The satisfaction that accompanies the successful completion of any work would be incomplete without the mention of the persons who made it possible, whose constant guidance and encouragement crown all the efforts. An understanding of the study like this, is never the outcome of the efforts of a single person, rather it bears the imprint of a number of persons who directly or indirectly helped me in the partial fulfillment of the project. I would be failing in my duty if I don't say a word of thanks to all these people.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Kandarpa Kumar Sarma, my supervisor without whose guidance, support and mentoring, I would not be able to complete this task. I must call myself lucky to be able to work under the supervision of such a supportive and friendly person.

Besides my supervisor, would like to thank Dr. Kumaresh Sarmah, Department of ECT, for his guidance and motivation throughout these years. I thank Dr. Pranjal Borah, Department of Instrumentation and USIC, for his valuable inputs at various phases of the work. I also thank Prof. Nikos E. Mastorakis, Technical University of Sofia, for his valuable support.

I thank Prof. Tulshi Bezboruah, Dr. Navajit Saikia, Prof. Utpal Sarma and Dr. Subhash Rajbongshi for their motivation, guidance and administrative support that made this journey smooth.

I would also forward my gratitude to all faculty members, non-teaching staff members and research scholars of the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering and the Department of Electronics and Communication Technology, Gauhati University for their valuable inputs and motivation at different phases of the Ph. D. work.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their support without which it would have been impossible to continue this work.
